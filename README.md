# CodeEditSymbols

A package containing all custom assets for CodeEdit. These are mostly custom [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/#creating-custom-symbols).

## How to use

### `NSImage`:

```swift
import CodeEditSymbols

let nsImage = NSImage.symbol(named: "name_of_the_symbol")
```

### `Image`:

```swift
import CodeEditSymbols

let image = Image(symbol: "name_of_the_symbol")
```

## Creating a new Asset

To create a new asset, follow the guide on [Apple's developer website](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/creating_custom_symbol_images_for_your_app).

Add the `.svg` you exported from `SF Symbols.app` to the `Symbols.xcassets` catalog.

> **Important:** Make sure your symbol looks great in every font weight.

## Tests

Also include snapshot tests for each symbol for `Image` as well as `NSImage`:

### `NSImage`:

```swift
// MARK: YOUR_SYMBOL_NAME

func testCreateNSImageYourSymbolName() {
    let image = NSImage.symbol(named: "your_symbol_name")
    let view = NSImageView(image: image)
    assertSnapshot(matching: view, as: .image)
}
```

### `Image`:

```swift
// MARK: YOUR_SYMBOL_NAME

func testCreateImageYourSymbolName() {
    let image = Image(symbol: "your_symbol_name")
    let view: NSView = NSHostingController(rootView: image).view
    assertSnapshot(matching: view, as: .image(size: view.intrinsicContentSize))
}
```

## Variants

Keep different variants of a symbol in the same parent folder and name them appropriately (see Apple's own symbols for reference).

You might have a symbol called `lock` and one where the symbol is inside a square where you would call that file `lock.square`. Also keep in mind to also provide a `.fill` variant if appropriate (`lock.fill`, `lock.square.fill`)

### Example of a `.fill` Variant

## Annotate the Symbol

As of version 3 of `SF Symbols` it is possible to create `multi-color`, `hierarchical` and `palette` annotations inside the `SF Symbols.app`. Be sure to annotate it accordingly if appropriate.
